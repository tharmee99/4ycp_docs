  abstract={In this paper, we implement an optical fiber communication system as an end-to-end deep neural network, including the complete chain of transmitter, channel model, and receiver. This approach enables the optimization of the transceiver in a single end-to-end process. We illustrate the benefits of this method by applying it to intensity modulation/direct detection (IM/DD) systems and show that we can achieve bit error rates below the 6.7% hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) threshold. We model all componentry of the transmitter and receiver, as well as the fiber channel, and apply deep learning to find transmitter and receiver configurations minimizing the symbol error rate. We propose and verify in simulations a training method that yields robust and flexible transceivers that allow-without reconfiguration-reliable transmission over a large range of link dispersions. The results from end-to-end deep learning are successfully verified for the first time in an experiment. In particular, we achieve information rates of 42 Gb/s below the HD-FEC threshold at distances beyond 40 km. We find that our results outperform conventional IM/DD solutions based on two- and four-level pulse amplitude modulation with feedforward equalization at the receiver. Our study is the first step toward end-to-end deep learning based optimization of optical fiber communication systems.},

  abstract={Deep learning has a wide application in the area of natural language processing and image processing due to its strong ability of generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network structure for jointly optimizing the transmitter and receiver in communication physical layer under fading channels. We build up a convolutional autoencoder to simultaneously conduct the role of modulation, equalization, and demodulation. The proposed system is able to design different mapping scheme from input bit sequences of arbitrary length to constellation symbols according to different channel environments. The simulation results show that the performance of neural network-based system is superior to traditional modulation and equalization methods in terms of time complexity and bit error rate under fading channels. The proposed system can also be combined with other coding techniques to further improve the performance. Furthermore, the proposed system network is more robust to channel variation than traditional communication methods.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in data analytics, since they deliver state-of-the-art accuracies. Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are recently proposed optimized variant of DNNs. BNNs constraint network weight and/or neuron value to either +1 or -1, which is representable in 1 bit. This leads to dramatic algorithm efficiency improvement, due to reduction in the memory and computational demands. This paper evaluates the opportunity to further improve the execution efficiency of BNNs through hardware acceleration. We first proposed a BNN hardware accelerator design. Then, we implemented the proposed accelerator on Aria 10 FPGA as well as 14-nm ASIC, and compared them against optimized software on Xeon server CPU, Nvidia Titan X server GPU, and Nvidia TX1 mobile GPU. Our evaluation shows that FPGA provides superior efficiency over CPU and GPU. Even though CPU and GPU offer high peak theoretical performance, they are not as efficiently utilized since BNNs rely on binarized bit-level operations that are better suited for custom hardware. Finally, even though ASIC is still more efficient, FPGA can provide orders of magnitudes in efficiency improvements over software, without having to lock into a fixed ASIC solution.},

  abstract={A pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) is a feed-forward computation perspective, which is widely used in the embedded systems requiring highly power-and-area efficiency. This paper realizes a binarized CNN which treats only binarized values (+1/-1) for the weights and the activation value. In this case, the multiplier is replaced by an XNOR circuit instead of a dedicated DSP block. Binarization for both weights and activation are more suitable for hardware implementation. However, the first convolutional layer still calculates in integer precision, since the input value is 8 bit RGB pixel, and not binarized. In this paper, we decompose the input value into maps of which each pixel is in 1-bit precision. The proposed method enables a binarized CNN to use bitwise operation in all layers, and shares a binarized convolutional circuit among all convolutional layers. We call this all binarized CNN. We compared our proposal with conventional ones. Since all binarized CNN do not require a dedicated DSP block, our proposal is smaller and 1.2 times faster than the typical CNNs, and almost maintains baseline classification accuracy. In addition, pipelined all binarized CNN achieved 1840 FPS, consumed 0.3 watts and its accuracy was 82.8%.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architecture for hardware implementation of Multilayer Feedforward Neural Networks (MFNNs) suitable for Digital Pre-Distortion (DPD) technique. This architecture consists of a single neuron, several storage units and multiplexors that allow the reconfiguration via software of the FPGA to handle different numbers of inputs, layers, neurons and threshold functions of the MFNN. This novel FPGA architecture offers the advantage of using FPGAs with less logical resources than those found in a Virtex-6. The usefulness of this novel FPGA architecture is demonstrated by the modeling of the AM-AM and AM-PM characteristics of a GaN class F PA and a Doherty PA in a Virtex-6 FPGA from Xilinx configured with two different MFNNs, using a 2.1 GHz LTE signal of 5 MHz of bandwidth. The results obtained with the FPGA implementation are compared with data computed with MATLAB achieving Normalize Mean Square Error (NMSE) better than -50 dB.},

  abstract={With the increasing wider application of neural networks, there has been significant focus on accelerating this class of computations. Larger, more complex networks are being proposed in a variety of domains, requiring more powerful computation platforms. The inherent parallelism and regularity of neural network structures means custom architectures can be adopted for this purpose. FPGAs have been widely used to implement such accelerators because of their flexibility, achievable performance, efficiency, and abundant peripherals. While platforms that utilize multicore CPUs and GPUs are also competitive, FPGAs offer superior energy efficiency, and a wider space of optimisations to enhance performance and efficiency. FPGAs are also more suitable for performing such computations at the edge, where multicore CPUs and GPUs are are less likely to be used and energy efficiency is paramount.},

However, as high computational complexity of spiking neural networks it is difficult to implement them efficiently using software simulation. In this paper a new hardware implementation method is proposed. In order to implement spiking neural networks more simply, efficiently and rapidly, a toolbox, which is composed of components of spiking neural networks, is developed for neuroscientists, computer scientists and electronic engineers to implement and simulate spiking neural networks in hardware. Using the toolbox a spiking neural network is easy to implement on a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) chip, because the toolbox takes advantages of Xilinx System Generator and works in Mat lab Simulink environment. The graphic user interface enables users easy to design and simulate spiking neural networks on FPGAs and speed up run-time. This paper presents the methodology in development of the toolbox and the examples are used to show its promising application.},

Our proposed implementations circumvent both issues. The designs' scalability allows the user to program and implement different applications with variable number of neurons, starting from one neuron to the maximum number of neurons in any layer, this is performed with programming-like ease and flexibility.

Recently, digital implementations of CeNNs on FPGA have attracted researchers from both academia and industry due to its high flexibility and short time-to-market. However, most existing implementations are not well optimized to fully utilize the advantages of FPGA platform with unnecessary design and computational redundancy that prevents speedup. We propose a multi-level optimization framework for energy efficient CeNN implementations on FPGAs. In particular, the optimization framework is featured with three level optimizations: system-, module-, and design-space-level, with focus on computational redundancy and attainable performance, respectively.

  abstract={Recently, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been widely used in the implementations of hardware accelerator for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, most of these existing accelerators are designed in the same idea as their ASIC counterparts, in which all operations from different layers are mapped to the same hardware units and working in a multiplexed way. This manner does not take full advantage of reconfigurability and customizability of FPGAs, resulting in a certain degree of computational efficiency degradation. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for FPGA-based CNN accelerator that maps all the layers to their own on-chip units and working concurrently as a pipeline. A comprehensive mapping and optimizing methodology based on establishing roofline model oriented optimization model is proposed, which can achieve maximum resource utilization as well as optimal computational efficiency. Besides, to ease the programming burden, we propose a design framework which can provide a one-stop function for developers to generate the accelerator with our optimizing methodology. We evaluate our proposal by implementing different modern CNN models on Xilinx Zynq-7020 and Virtex-7 690t FPGA platforms. Experimental results show that our implementations can achieve a peak performance of 910.2 GOPS on Virtex-7 690t, and 36.36 GOP/s/W energy efficiency on Zynq-7020, which are superior to the previous approaches.},

  abstract={Operators are pressured to maximize the achieved capacity over deployed links. This can be obtained by operating in the weakly nonlinear regime, requiring a precise understanding of the transmission conditions. Ideally, optical transponders should be capable of estimating the regime of operation from the received signal and feeding that information to the upper management layers to optimize the transmission characteristics; however, this estimation is challenging. This paper addresses this problem by estimating the linear and nonlinear signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from the received signal. This estimation is performed by obtaining features of two distinct effects: nonlinear phase noise and second-order statistical moments. A small neural network is trained to estimate the SNRs from the extracted features. Over extensive simulations covering 19,800 sets of realistic fiber transmissions, we verified the accuracy of the proposed techniques. Employing both approaches simultaneously gave measured performances of 0.04 and 0.20 dB of standard error for the linear and nonlinear SNRs, respectively.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently achieved remarkable performance in a myriad of applications, ranging from image recognition to language processing. Training such networks on graphics processing units (GPUs) currently offers unmatched levels of performance; however, GPUs are subject to large-power requirements. With recent advancements in high-level synthesis (HLS) techniques, new methods for accelerating deep networks using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are emerging. FPGA-based DNNs present substantial advantages in energy efficiency over conventional CPU- and GPU-accelerated networks. Using the Intel FPGA software development kit (SDK) for OpenCL development environment, networks described using the high-level OpenCL framework can be accelerated targeting heterogeneous platforms including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. These networks, if properly customized on GPUs and FPGAs, can be ideal candidates for learning and inference in resource-constrained portable devices such as robots and the Internet of Things (IoT) edge devices, where power is limited and performance is critical. Here, we introduce GPU- and FPGA-accelerated deterministically binarized DNNs, tailored toward weed species classification for robotic weed control. Our developed networks are trained and benchmarked using a publicly available weed species dataset, named DeepWeeds, which include close to 18 000 weed images. We demonstrate that our FPGA-accelerated binarized networks significantly outperform their GPU-accelerated counterparts, achieving a>7-fold decrease in power consumption, while performing inference on weed images 2.86 times faster compared to our best performing baseline full-precision GPU implementation. These significant benefits are gained whilst losing only 1.17% of validation accuracy. In this paper, this is a significant step toward enabling deep inference and learning on IoT edge devices, and smart portable machines such as agricultural robots, which is the target application.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved unprecedented success in a wide array of tasks. However, the performance of these systems depends directly on their hyper-parameters which often must be selected by an expert. Optimizing the hyper-parameters remains a substantial obstacle in designing DNNs in practice. In this work, we propose to select them using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Such biologically-inspired approaches have not been extensively exploited for this task. We demonstrate that PSO efficiently explores the solution space, allowing DNNs of a minimal topology to obtain competitive classification performance over the MNIST dataset. We showed that very small DNNs optimized by PSO retrieve promising classification accuracy for CIFAR-10. Also, PSO improves the performance of existing architectures. Extensive experimental study, backed-up with the statistical tests, revealed that PSO is an effective technique for automating hyper-parameter selection and efficiently exploits computational resources.},
