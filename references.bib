  abstract={In this paper, we implement an optical fiber communication system as an end-to-end deep neural network, including the complete chain of transmitter, channel model, and receiver. This approach enables the optimization of the transceiver in a single end-to-end process. We illustrate the benefits of this method by applying it to intensity modulation/direct detection (IM/DD) systems and show that we can achieve bit error rates below the 6.7% hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) threshold. We model all componentry of the transmitter and receiver, as well as the fiber channel, and apply deep learning to find transmitter and receiver configurations minimizing the symbol error rate. We propose and verify in simulations a training method that yields robust and flexible transceivers that allow-without reconfiguration-reliable transmission over a large range of link dispersions. The results from end-to-end deep learning are successfully verified for the first time in an experiment. In particular, we achieve information rates of 42 Gb/s below the HD-FEC threshold at distances beyond 40 km. We find that our results outperform conventional IM/DD solutions based on two- and four-level pulse amplitude modulation with feedforward equalization at the receiver. Our study is the first step toward end-to-end deep learning based optimization of optical fiber communication systems.},

  abstract={Deep learning has a wide application in the area of natural language processing and image processing due to its strong ability of generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network structure for jointly optimizing the transmitter and receiver in communication physical layer under fading channels. We build up a convolutional autoencoder to simultaneously conduct the role of modulation, equalization, and demodulation. The proposed system is able to design different mapping scheme from input bit sequences of arbitrary length to constellation symbols according to different channel environments. The simulation results show that the performance of neural network-based system is superior to traditional modulation and equalization methods in terms of time complexity and bit error rate under fading channels. The proposed system can also be combined with other coding techniques to further improve the performance. Furthermore, the proposed system network is more robust to channel variation than traditional communication methods.},

  abstract={We propose a novel low-complexity artificial neural network (ANN)-based nonlinear equalizer (NLE) for coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) and compare it with the recent inverse Volterra-series transfer function (IVSTF)-based NLE over up to 1000 km of uncompensated links. Demonstration of ANN-NLE at 80-Gb/s CO-OFDM using 16-quadrature amplitude modulation reveals a Q -factor improvement after 1000-km transmission of 3 and 1 dB with respect to the linear equalization and IVSTF-NLE, respectively.},

  abstract={Describing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using VHDL allows a further implementation of such a system on FPGA. Indeed, the principal point of using FPGA for ANNs is flexibility that gives it an advantage toward other systems like ASICS which are entirely dedicated to one unique architecture and allowance to parallel programming, which is inherent to ANN calculation system and one of their advantages. Usually FPGAs do not have unlimited logical resources integrated in a single package and this limitation forcesrequirement for optimizations for the design in order to have the best efficiency in terms of speed and resource consumption. This paper deals with the VHDL designing problems which can be encountered when trying to describe and implement such ANNs on FPGAs.},
