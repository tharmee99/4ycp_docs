\textbf{\textit{Abstract} --- This interim report describes the progress made thus far in the project with an analysis of the potential failure risk as well as difficulties encountered. A simulation of the optical channel was realised in the python programming language. Multiple helper functions were implemented to visualize distortions of the channel (BER vs SNR plots and eye diagrams). Encoding and decoding neural networks were implemented as part of an end-to-end autoencoder with the channel model in between. Training methods such as particle swarm optimization were explored to reach global optimum solutions. Furthermore, fixed-point precision numbers were enforced in neural networks to assess their impact on performance, as this would make the hardware implementation more efficient. Finally a list of field programmable gate arrays, analog to digital converters and digital to analog converters were short-listed for purchase in order to be utilized for the project.}
