Think of the introduction as a development of the context for the reader.

Peruse the literature quickly. 
Highlight the historical progression of the theory and work that has been done, citing the literature as you go. 

Use the citation mechanisms in the editor you are using. 
After the reader has some idea of what the historical background is, mention what is missing in it that your proposal is going to fill.
