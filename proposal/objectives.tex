Your objectives are the most important part of the proposal. 

Tell the reader what you intend to accomplish; 
	see if you can state the expected outcomes in a clear fashion so that you know, 
	and the reader knows, what you are going to have when finished.
	
What theory will you work out? 
Or what measurements will you make? 
Or what circuit will you build? 
The clearer you are with this, the higher the chances will be for knowing how to get there.
Break the Objectives down into pieces on which each of your teammates will focus. 
Show how the individual objectives create the projectâ€™s overall end objective.

Once you know what you will be doing, put the step sinto a Gantt Chart.Look online for a Gantt Chart description if you need to.
