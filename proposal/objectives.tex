The main objective of this project is to design a suitable neural network to optimize the transmission of data via a communication channel and implement it on an FPGA. The channel that will be of primary focus is the optical fibre communication channel where non-linearities introduced by chromatic dispersion and photodiode detection is a major problem that needs to be overcome. The project can be broken down into individual objectives that will need to be achieved:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Choosing an appropriate neural network architecture
    \item Simulating the communication channel and proposed transmitter/receiver
    \item Evaluating which neural network configuration perform best within limits of the chosen FPGA
    \item Implementing the neural network on a FPGA
    \item Training and Testing the System using an Optical Fibre Communication System
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Choosing an Appropriate Neural Network Architecture}

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{mlp.pdf}
	\caption{A very simple neural network; A fully connected MLP with 2 hidden layers and one output layer. The vector $\boldsymbol{x}$ is the input ($\boldsymbol{x} \in \rm I\!R^{3}$) and $\hat{y}$ is the output}
	\label{fig:mlp}	
\end{figure}

The modulation scheme as well as the encoding of the bits will be learned for the specific communication channel by a neural network at the transmitter. Likewise, at the receiving end of the communication system, a separate neural network will decode the received signal into a stream of bits. A simple neural network sometimes referred to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is shown in Fig \ref{fig:mlp}. This example shows a very simple MLP with an input layer followed by 3 layers. The last layer is known as the output layer as it produces the output. The 2 layers in-between the input and output layers are referred to as hidden layers. Each layer is characterized by its weight matrix $\boldsymbol{W}$ as well as it's activation function. During training it is $\boldsymbol{W}$ that is learnt to obtain the relationship between input and output.

The study carried out in \autocite{8664650} features a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) at the transmitting and receiving end of the communication system. Similar to our own project, the paper describes an end-to-end neural network implementation for the communication system. The channel used in the simulations is an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) model and does not consider potential non-linearities introduced in the channel. On the contrary, \autocite{6975096} describes a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based Non-Linear Equalizer(NLE) at the receiver for an optical communication system.  It should be noted that the paper describes an equalizer and not a demodulator/decoder. \autocite{8114893} describes an SVM implementation of a demodulator. This machine learning algorithm is not a neural network but was shown to still produce improved BERs to traditional demodulation techniques. 
\\
\\
When deciding on a NN we must not only choose an appropriate architecture but also choose the optimal activation function. The activation function is key as it is this that introduces non-linearity into the learnt model. Some of the most commonly used activation functions are the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLu), hyperbolic tangent (tanh), sigmoid and the leaky ReLU. The equations for these are given below:
\\
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        f_{ReLU}(z) &= \max(0,z) \\
        f_{tanh}(z) &= \frac{e^{z}-e^{-z}}{e^{z}+e^{-z}} \\
        f_{sigmoid}(z) &= \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}} \\
        f_{leakyReLU}(z) &= 
        \begin{cases}
            0.001z \quad & \text{if $z\leq 0$} \\
            z \quad & \text{if $z>0$}
        \end{cases}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
\\
Further research and literature review needs to be done into different architectures that are available and the requirements that need to be met by the transmitter and receiver of the communication channel. Depending on the chosen neural network architecture, a suitable FPGA will need to be decided on as well. Different architectures may demand different levels of hardware resources.

\subsection{Simulating the Communication Channel and Proposed Transmitter/Receiver}

An optical communication channel is comprised of a transmitter, receiver and the optical fibre connecting the two together. In order to simulate this communication channel, the mathematical representation of the signal at each stage of the channel needs to be established. The signal that enters the optical fibre is described by its electrical field of the EM field, known as its optical field and is expressed mathematically in the time domain as: 

\begin{equation}
    A(t, z) = |A(t,z)|e^{j\phi(t,z)}
\end{equation}
\\
\\
where z is the distance along the fibre and t is the time. A(t,z) is a phasor incorporating the optical amplitude $|A(t,z)|$ and optical phase $\phi(t,z)$. 
\\
\\
The signal suffers from chromatic dispersion as it traverses through the optical fibre, resulting in different frequency components of the signal being delayed by different amounts. For simulation simplicity, this effect will be simulated in the frequency domain due to a linear time delay vs frequency and can be expressed by the following mathematical expression:
\begin{equation}\label{opticalField}
    A(\omega,L) = A(\omega,0)e^{j\frac{1}{2}\beta_z\omega^2L}
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is angular frequency, $\beta_z$ is the group velocity dispersion and L is the fibre length.
\\
\\
At the receiver, photo-detection is carried out by using the proportional relationship between the output voltage and power of the signal which in turn is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the optical field, resulting in the following mathematical expression.

\begin{equation}
    V_{out}(t) = |A(t,L)|^2
\end{equation}
    where A(t,L) is the inverse Fourier transform of Eq.\ref{opticalField}.
\\
\\
To complete the mathematical representation of the signal through an optical channel, the receiver noise is applied to the photo-detected signal. This is in the form of white Gaussian noise (randomly generated voltages $\Delta V(t)$, which are generated with a normal distribution) which is added to both the model shot noise and the thermal noise. This voltage waveform is then the representation of the signal after it leaves the receiver.
\\
\\
The transmitting and receiving end as well as the channel itself need to be simulated as a channel model. The neural networks will most likely be implemented using the TensorFlow package with python. The python programming language was chosen for quick prototyping purposes as well as compatibility with TensorFlow. TensorFlow allows for quick experimentation and configuration of different neural network architectures. The above proposed model would be treated as a black box between the transmitting and receiving neural network. 

\subsection{Implementing the Neural Networks on a FPGA}

Implementing Neural Network on FPGA raises a number problems that need to be considered. Depending on the implemented Neural Network, its size, and the data structure it uses, a suitable FPGA board needs to selected. The option to use multiple FPGA boards that would be linked with fast communication protocols will be also considered, including overall board architecture. Some further considerations are discussed alongside existing literature in \S \ref{sec:cpu_gpu_fpga_asic} - \S \ref{sec:fpga_sigmoid}.


% \subsubsection{Neural Network optimisations in FPGA} 
% There are a number of research papers that include some optimisations to implement Neural Networks on FPGA: 
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Feed forward ANN on FPGA \autocite{7011454}
% 	\item ANN based PID controller on FPGA \autocite{5328349}
% \end{itemize}
% Further research will be done to find optimal implementation of Neural Network in HDL.

\subsection{Training and Testing the System using an Optical Fibre Communication System}

If time and circumstance permits the project could conclude by testing the designed system using an experimental setup to simulate the communication channel as opposed to a computer model. This would bring light to discrepancies between the real-life setup and the simulated model. As well as that, it would validate that the design works as well in an experimental setup as it does in simulation. The neural network could be trained at different lengths of fibre and observed to see how the learned parameters as well as the bit error rate differ to traditional methods of encoding/decoding.
