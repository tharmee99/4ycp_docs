\textbf{\textit{Abstract} --- MEng Project proposal for a design and construction project. The project will consists of end-to-end deep learning implementation on an FPGA to compensate for distortions and noise in optical fibre communication systems. Existing FPGA Neural Network implementations and machine learning methods used in communication systems are explored and taken inspiration from. In this project, a communication channel model will be constructed and tested against a number of Neural Networks with FPGA implementation in mind. A low precision, quantised and binary neural networks will be explored to reduce FPGA resources with aim to achieve sufficient performance. Finally simulated model and HDL implementation will be tested by real-time end-to-end deployment on an optical communication system.}
