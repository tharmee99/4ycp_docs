Safety Risks: Please identify the Laboratories in which you will work. 

The Managers of these labs MUST approve the assessment forms you have filled in. 

If you can, try to meet with them and show them the assessments you are planning to post.
The forms are available on Moodle.

Failure Risks: These are your estimates of the risks you face with your current plan. 
If you indicate a high risk of failure, that is, something with which you are uncomfortable, you should outline a new plan to use as backup in case the current plan does not work out for you. 
You can record the details of any alternative plan in your December Interim Report.
